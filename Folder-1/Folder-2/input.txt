In Go, there's no built-in way to directly convert a truly "generic" type to an int because Go is a statically typed language with strict type-checking. However, you can achieve this by using reflection, which allows you to work with types dynamically. Please note that using reflection 
comes with certain performance overhead and should be used judiciously.
